# Openwhisk Catalog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/apache/openwhisk-catalog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/apache/openwhisk-catalog)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

This openwhisk-catalog maintains the package catalogs of openwhisk. In OpenWhisk, the catalog
of packages gives you an easy way to enhance your app with useful capabilities, and to access
external services in the ecosystem. Examples of external services that are OpenWhisk-enabled
include the Slack and GitHub.system packages and sample packages.

The catalog is available as packages in the `/whisk.system` namespace. See [Browsing packages](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/packages.md#browsing-packages)
for information about how to browse the catalog by using the command line tool.

## How to install openWhisk-catalog

### Pre-requisites
- [openwhisk](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/README.md) is installed.
- Environment variable `OPENWHISK_HOME` is configured as the path to `openwhisk` source code directory.


### Install openwhisk-catalog

We should be able to run the script [packages/installCatalogUsingWskdeploy.sh](packages/installCatalogUsingWskdeploy.sh) to install the catalog like:

```
./packages/installCatalogUsingWskdeploy.sh [catalog_auth_key] [api_host] [cli_path]
```

The first argument `catalog_auth_key`, defines the secret key used to authenticate the openwhisk
service. The second argument `api_host`, determines the location, where the openwhisk edge host is running,
in the format of IP or hostname. The third argument `cli_path` is the full path to the `wsk` cli executable.

## How to create top-level packages

If your package is more involved you may want to create your own top-level packages repository using the [openwhisk-package-template](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-package-template). It will provide a good example on what a good template should include (i.e., sufficient help build, test and integrate into OpenWhisk).
